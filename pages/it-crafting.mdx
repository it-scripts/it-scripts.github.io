it-crafting is a lightweight crafting system for FiveM servers. Originally used as a part of the it-drugs script it has been separated into its own resource to allow for more customization and flexibility. The script comes with a fully configurable crafting system that allows players to craft items using raw materials. The script is easy to install and configure, making it a great addition to any FiveM server.

### `üìç` **| Fixed Possitions**
Our script offers fixed crafting positions that allow players to craft items at specific locations. 
Players can interact with these positions to access the crafting menu and create new items.
The fixed positions make it easy for players to find the crafting locations and create items without any hassle. The positions can be configured in the config file, allowing server admins to customize the crafting experience to fit their unique needs.

### `üî®` **| Crafting Tables**
Our script features crafting tables that allow players to transform raw materials into high-value items. Players can use these tables to craft items themselves, adding a layer of complexity to the crafting system. The Tables can be placed anywhere on the map, making it easy for players to craft their materials and create new items. Every table can be configured in the config file, allowing server admins to customize the experience to fit their unique needs.

### `üìä` **| Ingame Admin Menu**
Our script features an ingame admin menu that allows server admins to manage drugs and tables. Admins can use the menu view and manage all drugs and tables on the server, making it easy to keep track of everything. The admin menu can be accessed by typing `/crafting` in the chat.

### `üîß` **| Fully Configurable**
Our script is fully configurable, allowing server admins to customize every aspect to fit their unique needs. The config file contains a wide range of options that can be adjusted to change the crafting system's behavior. Server admins can configure the crafting tables, crafting positions, crafting recipes, and more, making it easy to create a unique experience for players.

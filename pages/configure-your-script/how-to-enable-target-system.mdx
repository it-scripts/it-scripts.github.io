# How to enable target system

## Target System
All it-scripts assets use the same target system for consistency and ease of use. 
To prevent errors, we have standardized the configuration and provided clear options for supported systems.

## Supported Target Systems
We are compatible with the following target systems:

<Steps>
    ### ox_target
    The most stable and reliable target system currently available.
    <ExternLink 
        href="https://github.com/overextended/ox_target"
        icon ={<IconBrandGithub size={16} />}
        manualTitle="ox_target GitHub Repository"
    ></ExternLink>

    ### qb-target
    Another widely used and supported system.
    <ExternLink 
        href="https://github.com/qbcore-framework/qb-target"
        icon ={<IconBrandGithub size={16} />}
        manualTitle="qb-target GitHub Repository"
    ></ExternLink>
</Steps>

Please always keep your targets updated to the latest available version.

## How To Enable The Target System
All it-scripts assets come with built-in support for target systems, allowing for seamless interaction with entities, objects, and more within your server. 
This configuration provides flexibility by supporting the two most popular target systems in FiveM: ox_target and qb-target.

<Steps>
    ### Find the it_bridge asset
    - Locate the **it_bridge** asset in your server's resources folder.
    - This asset serves as a bridge for all it-scripts and is essential for enabling the target system.

    ### Locate the config.lua file
    - Inside the **it_bridge** asset, find the **config.lua** file.
    - This file contains the configuration settings for the target system.

    ### Enable the Target System
    Look for the following configuration line in config.lua:
    ```lua
    --[[
    Supported interactions:
        * AUTO_DETECT: auto-detect interactions [Only detecting supported interactions below]
        * Interactions.OX: ox_target,
        * Interactions.QB: qb-target,
        * Interactions.NONE, distance interaction - press [E]
    ]]
    Config.Interactions = AUTO_DETECT
    ```
    By default, the target system is set to **AUTO_DETECT**, which automatically detects the available target system on your server.
    - If you want to use **ox_target**, set the value to **Interactions.OX**.
    - If you want to use **qb-target**, set the value to **Interactions.QB**.
    - If you want to use the distance interaction (press [E]), set the value to **Interactions.NONE**.

    ### Restart the server
    After making changes to the config.lua file, restart your server to apply the new target system settings.

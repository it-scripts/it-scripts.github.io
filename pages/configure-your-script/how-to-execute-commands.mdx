# How to execute commands
The ExecuteCommand() function lets you run any FiveM command directly from a script. 
It’s useful for automating tasks or triggering commands programmatically.

## How It Works
Simply call the function with the command you want to execute as a string:

<Steps>
### Run a Chat Command
This sends "Hello, world!" to the chat.
```lua
ExecuteCommand("say Hello, world!")
```
### Trigger a Custom Command
This runs a custom /heal command for the player ID 1.
```lua
ExecuteCommand("heal 1")
```
### Create a Shortcut Command
This makes a /healMe command that heals the player who runs it.
```lua
RegisterCommand("healMe", function()
    ExecuteCommand("heal " .. GetPlayerServerId(PlayerId()))
end, false)
```
That’s it! ExecuteCommand is a simple and powerful way to run commands directly from your scripts.

# How to set webhook system
## Webhook System
Webhooks are an essential feature for many it-scripts assets, enabling seamless communication between your server and Discord.
They are primarily used to send logs, updates, and other useful information to specific channels in your Discord server.

## Fivemanager Integration
**Comming Soon** *(Currently there is no script from us that uses Fivmanager)*

## Discord Webhooks
Discord webhooks are ideal for logging information, such as:
<Steps>
    ### Player Logs

## How to set up webhooks
<Steps>
    ### Create a Discord Webhook

    ### Locate the Webhook Configuration
    - To make ours scripts more secure the webhook system is located in a sperate file that is only loaded on the server.
    - The file is located in `server/sv_webhooks.lua`.
    - This file contains the configuration settings for the webhook system.

    ### Configure the Webhook
    - Open the `sv_webhooks.lua` file in a text editor.
    - Find the following configuration section:
    <Tabs items={['One webhook', 'Multiple webhooks']}>
       <Tabs.Tab>
        ```lua
        local webhookSettings = {
            ['active'] = false, -- Set to true to enable the webhook
            ['name'] = 'it_referral', -- Name for the webhook
            ['avatar'] = 'https://i.imgur.com/mbM87BJ.png', -- Avatar for the webhook
            ['url'] = 'YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL', -- Webhook URL
        }
        ```
        If you want to activate the webhook system, set the `active` attribute to `true`.
        - Replace `YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL` with the actual webhook URL you created in Discord.
        - You can also customize the `name` and `avatar` attributes to personalize the webhook.
        </Tabs.Tab>
       <Tabs.Tab>
        ```lua
        local webhookSettings = {
            ['active'] = false, -- Set to true to enable the webhook
            ['name'] = 'it-drugs', -- Name for the webhook
            ['avatar'] = 'https://i.imgur.com/KvZZn88.png', -- Avatar for the webhook
            ['urls'] = {
                ['plant'] = 'https://discord.com/api/webhooks/**************/*************************', -- Webhook URL for plant actions
                ['table'] = nil, --'', -- Webhook URL for table actions
                ['sell'] = nil, --'', -- Webhook URL for sell actions
                ['message'] = nil, --'', -- Webhook URL for messages
            }
        }
        ```
        If you want to activate the webhook system, set the `active` attribute to `true`.
        Now you can set multiple webhooks for different actions.
        - Replace `nil` with the actual webhook URL you created in Discord. Example:
        ```lua
        ['plant'] = 'https://discord.com/api/webhooks/**************/*************************', -- Webhook URL for plant actions
        ```
        - You can also customize the `name` and `avatar` attributes to personalize the webhook.
        </Tabs.Tab>
    </Tabs>
    ### Save and Restart
    - Save the changes to the `sv_webhooks.lua` file.
    - Restart the script or the server to apply the changes.
    - The webhook system is now active and will send logs to the specified Discord channel.
</Steps>

# How to change kay bindings

## Register Key Mapping
<Callout type="info">
The new keybinds will apply only to new players or those who reset their keybinds manually.
</Callout>
To properly organize your keybinds and optimize your resource, weâ€™ve adopted the FiveM native RegisterKeyMapping. 
This eliminates the need for constant checks (while loops) for key presses, significantly improving performance. 
This native works by triggering the associated chat command whenever the keybind is pressed.

### Client customization
Players can now change their own keybinds directly in-game.

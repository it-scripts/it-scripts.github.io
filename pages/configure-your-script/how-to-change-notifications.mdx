# How to change notifications
## Change Notifications

Configuring notifications in it-scripts assets is simple and straightforward.
Notifications are used to display information, successes, and errors in-game.
All it-scripts assets share the same notification system, ensuring consistency across different scripts.

<Steps>
### Delete notifications
Delete the current notification logic inside the **ShowNotification** function.

### Add your own notification logic
Manually add your desired notification export or method.

### Always test with backups
Always test your changes with backups to ensure everything works as expected.
</Steps>

### Editing Notifications
All configurable notifications are located in `shared/functions.lua` in this file, youâ€™ll find the ShowNotification function, which controls how notifications are displayed.

If you want to customize the notification system or integrate a new one, you can do so by editing the ShowNotification function. Below is an example of how to modify it for a new system:
```lua
function ShowNotification(source, message, type)
    -- Bridge.Functions.Notify(message, type) are the default Framework notifications
    -- You can change this to your own notification systems
    if source ~= nil then -- Server Messages
        if type == 'Error' then
            exports.it_bridge:SendNotification(source, 'it-drugs', message, 5000, "Error", true)
        elseif type == 'Success' then
            exports.it_bridge:SendNotification(source, 'it-drugs', message, 5000, "Success", true)
        else
            exports.it_bridge:SendNotification(source, 'it-drugs', message, 5000, "Info", false)
        end
    else -- Client Messages
        if type == 'Error' then
            exports.it_bridge:SendNotification('it-drugs', message, 5000, "Error", true)
        elseif type == 'Success' then
            exports.it_bridge:SendNotification('it-drugs', message, 5000, "Success", true)
        else
            exports.it_bridge:SendNotification('it-drugs', message, 5000, "Info", false)
        end
    end
end
```
This example uses the `it_bridge` notification system, but you can replace it with any other notification system you prefer.

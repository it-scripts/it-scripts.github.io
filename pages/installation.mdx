# Installation

<Callout type="info">
  We highly recommend using **txAdmin** to install your FiveM server. \
  For detailed instructions, refer to [Setting up a server using txAdmin](https://docs.fivem.net/docs/server-manual/setting-up-a-server-txadmin/).
</Callout>

<Steps>
  ### Download the server

  Download the latest [FiveM artifacts](https://runtime.fivem.net/artifacts/fivem/build_server_windows/master/) and extract the files.

  ### Start the server installation

  Run `FXServer.exe` to begin the installation and follow all the steps.

  ### Deploy the recipe

  <Tabs items={[ 'Qbox Unstable', 'Qbox Lean', 'Qbox Stable']} defaultIndex="0">
    <Tabs.Tab>
      The Qbox Unstable Recipe comes with *all* of our actively maintained resources. \
      Use this if you're looking for a complete server base.

      ```ansi filename="Qbox Unstable Recipe" copy
      https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Qbox-project/txAdminRecipe/main/qbox.yaml
      ```
    </Tabs.Tab>
    <Tabs.Tab>
      The Qbox Lean Recipe is a stripped down version of Qbox, without excess resources,
      and it does not include any criminal or civilian activities. \
      Use this if you're looking for a smaller server base to build off of.

      ```ansi filename="Qbox Lean Recipe" copy
      https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Qbox-project/txAdminRecipe/main/qbox-lean.yaml
      ```
    </Tabs.Tab>
    <Tabs.Tab>
      The Qbox Stable Recipe comes with the resources we consider stable, based on our [Release Readiness](./release) guidelines. \
      Use this if you're looking for the most stable experience.

      <Callout type="warning">
        Since many Qbox resources are still a work-in-progress, some important resources are still considered unstable,
        and are currently missing from this recipe. This may result in various issues.
        You are expected to find alternatives by yourself, or to download the unstable versions of those resources.
      </Callout>

      ```ansi filename="Qbox Stable Recipe" copy

      ```
    </Tabs.Tab>
  </Tabs>

  Once you have completed all of the installation steps, run the server.

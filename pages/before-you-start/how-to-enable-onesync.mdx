# How to enable OneSync
OneSync is a feature in FiveM that allows for larger server capacities and improved synchronization of entities and players. 
Enabling OneSync is a straightforward process that requires a simple edit to your server.cfg file.

### Steps to Enable OneSync
<Steps>
### Open Your Server.cfg File
- Navigate to your server directory and locate the `server.cfg` file.
- Open the `server.cfg` file using a text editor (e.g., Notepad, Visual Studio Code).

### Add the OneSync Command
Add the following line to your `server.cfg` file to enable OneSync:
```plaintext
onesync on
```

### Optional: Enable OneSync Infinity
If your server needs support for more than 64 players (up to 1024), enable OneSync Infinity by adding this line:
```plaintext
onesync_enableInfinity 1
```
Infinity mode is designed for large-scale servers and requires proper resource optimization.

## Save and Restart
- Save the changes to your `server.cfg` file.
- Restart your server for the changes to take effect.

# How to update my server
To ensure your FiveM server runs smoothly and avoids critical issues, it’s essential to keep your framework, artifacts, and gamebuild up to date. Here's a detailed guide:

<Steps>
### Framework
Your server framework is the most important thing, we will always recommend the great ESX, but here is a small guide on how to update it correctly.

### Artifacts
Artifacts are everything on our server, they are the brain of it.

### Gamebuild
The gamebuild is the version of the game or DLC that we will run, we always recommend the latest version.

</Steps>

## Framework Update
Updating your framework is a crucial step before proceeding with artifacts and gamebuild updates. Follow these steps carefully:

<Steps>
### Download the Official Framework
- For **es_extebded (ESX)**, visit the official [**ESX GitHub repository**]()
- For **QBCore**, visit the official [**QBCore GitHub repository**]()
- For **Obox Framework**, visit the official [**Obox GitHub repository**]()
- For **ND_Core**, visit the official [**ND_Core GitHub repository**]()

### Replace Your Current Framework Folder
Completely remove your existing framework folder and replace it with the latest version from GitHub. Avoid merging files as this may cause unexpected issues.

### Do Not Rename the Framework Folder
Keep the folder name exactly as provided by the official repository (e.g., qb-core or es_extended). 
Renaming it can lead to severe compatibility problems with scripts, as they rely on specific folder names for proper integration. 
Renaming your framework does not make it "custom"—it makes it dysfunctional. 

</Steps>

### Update Artifacts
Artifacts are the core files needed to run your server. Keeping them updated is essential for compatibility with the latest FiveM features.

<Steps>

### Remove Old Artifacts
Delete the current `artifacts` folder from your server directory. This ensures that no outdated files remain that could cause conflicts.

### Download Latest Artifacts
Get the latest version of artifacts for your operating system from the official FiveM links:
- [Windows Artifacts](https://runtime.fivem.net/artifacts/fivem/build_proot_win64/master/)
- [Linux Artifacts](https://runtime.fivem.net/artifacts/fivem/build_proot_linux/master/)

### Extract and Replace
Extract the downloaded artifacts and replace your old artifacts folder completely.

</Steps>

## Update Gamebuild
Updating the gamebuild is the final step in ensuring your server is running the latest version of FiveM. Follow these steps:

<Steps>
### Open Your server.cfg File
Find the `server.cfg` file in your server directory. This file contains all the configuration settings for your server.

### Edit Your Server Configuration
Open the `server.cfg` file in a text editor and locate the line that specifies the gamebuild. It should look something like this:
```plaintext
set sv_enforceGameBuild "3258"
```

Replace the number with the latest gamebuild version. You can find the latest gamebuild version on the official [FiveM website](https://runtime.fivem.net/artifacts/fivem/build_proot_win64/master/).

</Steps>

## Why Is This Important?
- Keeping your framework, artifacts, and gamebuild updated ensures your server is compatible with the latest scripts and features.
- Not updating can lead to crashes, bugs, or incomplete functionality.
- Avoid renaming folders or using unofficial versions of frameworks, as this often causes critical errors.

By following these steps, you ensure a stable, well-functioning server that minimizes common issues.

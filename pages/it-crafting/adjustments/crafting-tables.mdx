# ⚙️・Crafting Tables
So let's start setting up the crafting tables.

## Config.CraftingTables
The individual processing tables can now be configured here:

```lua
['simple_crafting_table'] = {
        zone = vector3(2.0, 1.0, 2.0),
        label = 'Weed Processing Table', -- Label for the table
        model = 'v_res_tre_table2', -- Exanples: freeze_it-scripts_empty_table, freeze_it-scripts_weed_table, freeze_it-scripts_coke_table, freeze_it-scripts_meth_table
        restricCrafting = {
            ['onlyOnePlayer'] = true, -- Only one player can use the table at a time
            ['onlyOwnerCraft'] = false, -- Only the owner of the table can use it
            ['onlyOwnerRemove'] = true, -- Only the owner of the table can remove it
            ['zones'] = {}, -- Zones where the table can be used
            ['jobs'] = {}
        },
        blip = {
            display = true, -- Display blip on map
            sprite = 446, -- Select blip from (https://docs.fivem.net/docs/game-references/blips/)
            displayColor = 2, -- Select blip color from (https://docs.fivem.net/docs/game-references/blips/)
            displayText = 'Crafting Table',
        },
        recipes = {
            -- Here you can add as many recipes as you want
        }
    }
```

```lua
['simple_crafting_table']
```
This is the name of the item to which this configuration is bound. The item can now be used to set up a table in the game.

---

```lua
target = {
    size = vector3(3.5, 1.0, 1.0),
    rotation = 0.0,
    drawSprite = true,
    interactDistance = 1.5,
},
```
As soon as the player places the table, the script will create a zone around the table. The zone is used to interact with the table.
Here you can change some settings for the target zone.
- `size` * - The size of the target zone. The first value is the width, the second value is the length, and the third value is the height of the zone.
- `rotation` * - The rotation of the target zone. The value is in degrees. If you dont want to use this you can remove it.
- `drawSprite` * - If set to `true`, a sprite will be displayed at the target zone. If set to `false`, no sprite will be displayed.
- `interactDistance` * - The distance at which the player can interact with the table.

`*` All these values are optional and can be removed if you dont want to use them. But please do not remove the target table.

<Callout type="info">
If you are using a model the script will automatically set the size and rotation of the target zone.
So you dont need to set the size and rotation if you are using a model. You can just keep the default values.

In some cases the rotation of the target zone is not correct. In this case you can set the rotation manually.

```lua
model = 'v_res_tre_table2'
```
The model of the processing table here can theoretically be used with any Fivem model.

---

```lua
restricCrafting = {
    ['onlyOnePlayer'] = true, -- Only one player can use the table at a time
    ['onlyOwnerCraft'] = false, -- Only the owner of the table can use it
    ['onlyOwnerRemove'] = true, -- Only the owner of the table can remove it
    ['zones'] = {}, -- Zones where the table can be used
    ['jobs'] = {}
},
```

- `onlyOnePlayer` - As the name suggests, only one player can use the table at a time.
- `onlyOwnerCraft` - Only the owner of the table can use the table.
- `onlyOwnerRemove` - Only the owner of the table can remove the table.
- `zones` - Zones where the table can be used.
    - The zones can be defined in the `Config.Zones` table.
    - If you want to use the table everywhere, you can leave the table empty.
    - If you want to add a zone, you can add the zone name to the table like this: `{'crafting_zone_one'}`. Now the table can only be used in this zone.
- `jobs` - Jobs that can use the table.
    - If you want to allow all jobs to use the table, you can leave the table empty.
    - If you want to add a job, you can add the job name to the table like this: `['police'] = true`. Now only the police can use the table.
    You also hove the option to add a job with a specific grade like this: `['police'] = {1, 2}`. Now only the police with the grade 1 and 2 can use the table.

---

```lua
blip = {
    display = true, -- Display blip on map
    scale = 1.0, -- Blip scale
    sprite = 446, -- Select blip from (https://docs.fivem.net/docs/game-references/blips/)
    displayColor = 2, -- Select blip color from (https://docs.fivem.net/docs/game-references/blips/)
    displayText = 'Crafting Table',
},
```
The blip fie zone can be set here. 
If set to `true`, the blip will be displayed on the map as soon as the table is placed.


### Recipes
Each table can theoretically have an infinite number of recipes, how exactly a recipe must look is explained here

<Callout type="warning">
If you use the ox_inventory, please use the following template to add the tables to your items.lua:
```lua
["item_name"] = {
		label = "Item Label",
		weight = 1000,
		stack = false,
		close = true,
		description = "Item Description",
		server = {
			export = "it-drugs.placeCraftingTable",
		},
		client = {
			image = "item_name.png",
		}
	},
```
**Each `item_name` must be replaced with the actual item name**

        ['WEAPON_HAMMER'] = {amount = 1, remove = false}
    },
    outputs = {
        ['lockpick'] = 2
    },
    processTime = 15,
    failChance = 15,
    showIngrediants = false,
    animation = {
        dict = 'anim@amb@drug_processors@coke@female_a@idles',
        anim = 'idle_a',
    },
    skillCheck = {
        enabled = true,
        difficulty = {'easy', 'easy', 'medium', 'easy'},

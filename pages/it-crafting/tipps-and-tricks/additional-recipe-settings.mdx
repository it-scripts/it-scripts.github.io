# Additional Recipe Settings

## Add custom animation
If you do not want to use the normal animation for a recipe in a recipe, you can also easily change this via the Config

<Steps>
### Get your animation
A good resource to find animation is:
<ExternLink 
    href="https://forge.plebmasters.de/animations"
    manualTitle="Pleb Masters: Forge - GTA V Animations List | Data Browser | Search and Preview Tool"
    icon={IconExternalLink} >
</ExternLink>

### Add the animation to the Config
Add the following code to the recipe you want to change the animation for:
```lua copy
animation = {
    dict = 'you animation dict', -- Animation dict
    anim = 'your animation name', -- Animation name
}
```

**Example:**
```lua
animation = {
    dict = 'anim@gangops@facility@servers@bodysearch@', -- Animation dict
    anim = 'player_search', -- Animation name
}
```
</Steps>

<Accordion title="Full Example">
```lua
['lockpick'] = {
    label = 'Lockpick',
    ingrediants = {
        ['scrapmetal'] = {amount = 3, remove = true},
        ['WEAPON_HAMMER'] = {amount = 1, remove = false}
    },
    outputs = {
        ['lockpick'] = 2
    },
    processTime = 15,
    failChance = 15,
    showIngrediants = false,
    animation = {
        dict = 'anim@amb@drug_processors@coke@female_a@idles',
        anim = 'idle_a',
    },
    skillCheck = {
        enabled = true,
        difficulty = {'easy', 'easy', 'medium', 'easy'},
        keys = {'w', 'a', 's', 'd'}
    }
},
```
</Accordion>

## Add particles
<Callout type="warning">
    This feature is not fully implemented and tested yet and may not work as expected.
</Callout>

This features allows you to add particles to your recipes. This can be used to make the recipe more interactive.

<Steps>
### Get your particle
A good resource to find particles is:
<ExternLink
    href="https://www.vespura.com/fivem/particle-list/"
    manualTitle="Particles List"
    icon= {IconExternalLink} >
</ExternLink>

### Add the particle to the Config
Add the following code to the recipe you want to add the particle to:
```lua copy
    particlefx = {
        dict = 'your dict name',
        particle = 'your particle name',
        color = {r = 255, g = 255, b = 255},
        offset = {x = 0.0, y = 0, z = 0},
        scale = 0.5,
    },
```

---

```lua
color = {r = 255, g = 255, b = 255},
```
The color of the particle, each value can be between 0 and 255 and represents the RGB color space.

---

```lua
offset = {x = 0.0, y = 0, z = 0},
```

The offset of the particle, this can be used to move the particle to a different position.
Due to the fact that some particles are not centered, it is recommended to play around with the values.
If you are using the default table props provided by the script, you can use the following values:


```lua copy
offset = {x = 0.0, y = -1.5, z = 1.0},
```

---

```lua
scale = 0.5,
```
The scale of the particle, this can be used to make the particle bigger or smaller.

['lockpick'] = {
        label = 'Lockpick',
        ingrediants = {

            ['WEAPON_HAMMER'] = {amount = 1, remove = false}
        },
        outputs = {
            ['lockpick'] = 2
        },
        processTime = 15,
        failChance = 15,
        showIngrediants = false,
        particlefx = {
            dict = 'core',
            particle = 'ent_amb_torch_fire',
            color = {r = 255, g = 255, b = 255},
            offset = {x = 0.0, y = -1.5, z = 1.0},
            scale = 0.5,
        },
        skillCheck = {
            enabled = true,
            difficulty = {'easy', 'easy', 'medium', 'easy'},
            keys = {'w', 'a', 's', 'd'}
        }
    },
```

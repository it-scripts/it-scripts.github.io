Failed to verify protected resource it-resourceName
Ensure the encrypted files are copied; the .fxap file must be included. Some FTP programs skip these files. If you use FileZilla, try using WinSCP instead.

## You lack the required entitlement to use it-resourceName
Your server is using a FiveM server license key that is not linked to the initial purchase, meaning the resource(s) were purchased on the wrong FiveM account.
It could also be that you installed the asset without having restarted your server previously, restart the server to verify that this is not the case.

## Syntax error `</1>` or similar
The problem can be caused by several factors. Maybe you do not have the artifact version higher than +4960, be sure to use that artifact version or higher. You can get your latest Linux or Windows artifacts here.
Another factor could be that you have edited encrypted code which you should not do or simply that you did not restart the server after installing this asset, try to resolve it with these two more options.

# Understanding CFX Auth
The **FiveM** asset escrow system secures assets by encrypting critical files, ensuring that exclusive **it-scripts** assets are protected against unauthorized use or modification.
Below is a detailed guide to common errors and solutions, with titled sections for clarity.

## Failed to Verify Protected Resource
This error usually means the files where corrupted during transfer.

<Steps>
### Error
Failed to verify protected resource (it_resourceName). 

### Cause
Files were corrupted during transfer.

### Solution
- Ensure all files, including `.fxap`, are uploaded correctly.
- Use [**WinSCP**](https://winscp.net/) instead of FileZilla for transferring files, as FileZilla might skip encrypted components.
</Steps>


## You lack the required entitlement to use it_resourceName
This error occurs when your server license key is not linked to the account that purchased the asset.

<Steps>
### Error
You lack the required entitlement to use it_resourceName.

### Cause
The server license key is not linked to the account that purchased the asset.

### Solution
- Ensure the **server license key** is linked to the account that purchased the asset.
- Restart your server after installation to apply any changes.
</Steps>

## Syntax Errors
This error can be caused by several factors:

<Steps>
### Error
Syntax error `<\/1>` or similar issues.

### Cause
Outdated artifacts or attempts to edit encrypted code.

### Solution
- Update to **artifact version 4960 or newer**.
- Do not attempt to edit encrypted code, as it will lead to syntax errors.
- Restart your server after installation to apply any changes.

</Steps>

## Recommendations
<Steps>
### Use the Latest Artifacts
Always run **[artifact version 4960 or newer](https://runtime.fivem.net/artifacts/fivem/)** to avoid compatibility issues with the CFX Auth system.

### Use Reliable File Transfer Tools
Switch to **[WinSCP](https://winscp.net/)** for transferring files to avoid corruption. FileZilla may skip encrypted components, leading to errors.

### Avoide Editing Encrypted Code
Never attempt to edit encrypted code. This will lead to syntax errors and other issues. If you need to make changes, contact the asset developer for assistance.

### Restart Your Server Regularly
After installing or updating assets, always restart your server to apply changes and ensure everything is functioning correctly.

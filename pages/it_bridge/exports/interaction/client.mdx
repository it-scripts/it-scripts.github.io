### Interactions Options
```lua
{
  label = 'string', -- The label of the interaction.
  name = 'string', -- The name of the interaction.
  icon = 'string', -- The icon of the interaction.
  item = {}, -- List of item you need to have to use the interaction.
  groups = {}, -- List of groups you need to have to use the interaction.
  canInteract = function(entity, distance), -- Function to check if the player can interact with the entity.
  onSelect = function(entity), -- Function to execute when the player selects the interaction.
  distance = number, -- The distance the player needs to be to interact with the entity.
}
```

If you want your script to work with all Disptach systems that are integrated in it-brige please make sure that you enter all these data

## CreateBoxZone
```lua
exports.it_bridge:CreateBoxZone(options, boxData)
```

### BoxData
```lua
{

  size = vector3, -- The size of the box zone.
  rotation = number, -- The rotation of the box zone.
  debug = boolean, -- If the box zone should be debugged.
  drawSprite = boolean, -- If the box zone should draw a sprite.

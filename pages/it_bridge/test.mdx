# How to test?
Welcome to the **it_bridge** test guide, where you can learn how to completely test the our asset on your server, following each step we will achieve a clean and fluid test where you will find any problems with the bridge on your server, as long as the documentation has been completed.

<Callout type="warning">
    Before you start testing the script, make sure that you have followed the installation guide and that the script is correctly installed on your server.
</Callout>

<Steps>
### Configuration of the script
First you have to configure the **it_bridge** script, you can do this in the `config.lua` file.
On most servers you can leave the default settings, but if you want to change something you can do this.

### Start the it_bridge script
After you have configured the script, you can start the script on your server.
If you followed the install guide correctly, the script should start aumaotically when you start your server.
If the script does not start automatically, you can start it manually with the following command in your txAdmin Console:
```lua
start it_bridge
```

After starting the script, you should see a message in your server console after a few seconds, that the script has started successfully.
The script will also tell you which settings are currently active. Please make sure these settings are correct.

# Installation

## Asset dependencies
| Dependencies | Links |
| --- | --- |
| ox_lib | https://github.com/overextended/ox_lib/releases |

<Callout type="info">

</Callout>

## Asset positioning
<Callout type="error">
  Correctly position the assets by following this step, if something goes wrong you will probably get errors about exports not found, do not skip this step.
</Callout>

When you have downloaded the asset, you will have a folder with the name of the asset, inside you will find to seperate folders, each folder is on asset.

We recommend to create a folder with the name `[it-scripts]` in your resources folder, and then move the asset folders inside the `[it-scripts]` folder.

After you added both assets you have to add the `it_bridge` resource to your `server.cfg` file.

<Callout type="warning">
  In your `server.cfg` file you have to add the `it_bridge` resource after any script the bridge needs to work for most servers that will be
  - Your Framework
  - Your Inventory Script
  - Your Notification Script *(If you have one on your server)*
  - Your TextUI Script *(If you have one on your server)*
  - Your Target Script *(If you have one on your server)*
  - Your Disptach Script *(If you have one on your server)*
  - ox_lib
</Callout>

**Example:**
```lua
-- First we will start the Database
ensure oxmysql

-- Then we will start the cores, never below
ensure es_extended or qb-core

-- Your inventory system, always on top
ensure inventory

--Then we start all the dependencies
ensure ox_lib

-- Then you need to start all system you selected in the config file

-- Now you can start the it_bridge script
ensure it_bridge

-- After that you can start any other it script you want to use
```

<Callout type="error">
Do not add the `bridge_tester` resource to your `server.cfg` file, this resource is only for testing purposes and should not be used on a live server.

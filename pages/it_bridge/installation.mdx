<Callout type="error">
  If you do not have programming experience, we recommend that you read each step completely without skipping any lines, since all documentation is important and should not be ignored under any circumstances. 
  If you have a trusted developer, you can install this quickly, easily and safely if you complete this documentation step by step.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info">
  If at the end of this documentation you still have any problems, review each step again, after having checked that everything is correct, 
  you can obtain more information about common errors in the Common Problems section within this same documentation to seek help independently.

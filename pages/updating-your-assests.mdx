# Updating your assets

<Callout type="info">
  When updating your assets, make sure to always replace the `fxmanifest.lua` file
  and if the script is from github also replace the `version` file
  to make sure the version checker works properly.
</Callout>

## Staying Updated
Join our Discord community to access changelogs. These logs provide details about recent updates, fixes, and new features for your assets.

## Avoiding update errors
If you experience errors after updating, it’s often better to re-download and replace the entire asset. 
Remember to make a backup of your old files before doing this, as partial updates or incorrectly applied patches can break multiple parts of the asset.

<Steps>
### Full Replacement
If errors occur after an update, it’s best to **re-download and replace the entire asset** rather than attempting partial updates.

### Backup Your Files
Always make a backup of your old files before replacing them. This ensures you can revert to a working version if needed.
</Steps>

## General Errors

```ansi
[1m [31mattempt to index a nil value (global 'lib')[39m[22m
```
If you get this error you either don't have [ox_lib](https://github.com/overextended/ox_lib) installed on your server or you start it after the it-drugs script.
Make sure to start the ox_lib script before the it-drugs script.

## Database Errors


## Animation Error

```ansi
[1m [31mattempt to index a nil value (field 'animation')
```

If you get this error that means you are using **1.2.4** of the script. 
We would recommend updating to the latest version of the script. This will fix the error.

However, if you want to fix it manually, you can do the following:

<Steps>
### Open the `config.lua` file.
### Search for `Config.ProcessingTables`.
### Add the following lines to every recipe in every processing tables:
```lua
animation = {
    dict = 'anim@gangops@facility@servers@bodysearch@',
    anim = 'player_search',
},
```
</Steps>

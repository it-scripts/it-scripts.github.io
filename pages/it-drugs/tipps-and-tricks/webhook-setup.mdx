# Webhook Setup
With version `1.3.0` of it-drugs the creation of webhooks is changing. From now on the webhooks are set entirely in the file `server/sv_webhooks`.

```lua
local webhookSettings = {
    ['active'] = false, -- Set to true to enable the webhook
    ['name'] = 'it-drugs', -- Name for the webhook
    ['avatar'] = 'https://i.imgur.com/KvZZn88.png', -- Avatar for the webhook
    ['urls'] = {
        ['plant'] = nil, --'', -- Webhook URL for plant actions
        ['table'] = nil, --'', -- Webhook URL for table actions
        ['sell'] = nil, --'', -- Webhook URL for sell actions
        ['message'] = nil, --'', -- Webhook URL for messages
    }
}
```

It is now possible to use your own webhook links for the various individual actions of the user.

If a valid webhook id is entered and the attribute active is set to true, a webhook message is sent for the corresponding category.

```lua
local webhookSettings = {
    ['active'] = true, -- Set to true to enable the webhook
    ['name'] = 'it-drugs', -- Name for the webhook
    ['avatar'] = 'https://i.imgur.com/KvZZn88.png', -- Avatar for the webhook
    ['urls'] = {
        ['plant'] = 'https://discord.com/api/webhooks/**************/*************************', -- Webhook URL for plant actions
        ['table'] = nil, --'', -- Webhook URL for table actions
        ['sell'] = nil, --'', -- Webhook URL for sell actions
        ['message'] = nil, --'', -- Webhook URL for messages
    }
}
```
In this example now the script only sends webhook messages when a user interacts with a plant.

<Callout type="info">
Please note that only messages with in the sell and message area will be sent immediately. 
The messages for plants and tables are sent every minute all together to prevent Discord from rate limiting your Discord server
</Callout>

# Add required items
A desired feature is that items are required when an item is planted or harvested, this feature is now available with version <span style={{color: "green"}}>**v1.3.0**</span> but not active by default in the Config.lua. 
To add the feature the following code must be added to each plant.

```lua copy
reqItems = { -- Items required to plant the seed
    ["planting"] = {
    },
    ["harvesting"] = {
    }
},
```
In each of the 2 categories you can add as many items as you want, the schema you have to use is as follows:

```lua copy
['item_amount'] = {amount = number, remove = true or false},
```

**Example:**
```lua
['watering_can'] = {amount = 1, remove = true},
```

<Callout type="warning">
Please remember to register all the items you list here in your inventory!
</Callout>

## Full example

```lua
['weed_lemonhaze_seed'] = {
    label = 'Lemon Haze', -- Label for the plant
    plantType = 'plant1', -- Choose plant types from (plant1, plant2, small_plant)
    growthTime = 2, -- Cutsom growth time in minutes false if you want to use the global growth time
    onlyZone = false, -- Set to zone id if you want to plant this seed only in a specific zone 
    zones = {'weed_zone_one', 'weed_zone_two'}, -- Zones where the seed can be planted
    products = { -- Item the plant is going to produce when harvested with the max amount
        ['weed_lemonhaze'] = {min = 1, max = 4},  
        --['other_item'] = {min = 1, max = 2}
    },
    seed = {
        chance = 50, -- Percent of getting back the seed
        min = 1, -- Min amount of seeds
        max = 2 -- Max amount of seeds
    },
    time = 3000, -- Time it takes to plant/harvest in miliseconds
    reqItems = { -- Items required to plant the seed
        ["planting"] = {
            ['watering_can'] = {amount = 1, remove = true},
            ['shovel'] = {amount = 1, remove = false},
        },
        ["harvesting"] = {
            ['watering_can'] = {amount = 1, remove = true},
            ['shovel'] = {amount = 1, remove = false},
        }
    }
},
```

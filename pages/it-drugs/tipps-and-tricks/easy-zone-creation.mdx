# Easy Zone Creation
<Callout type="info">
This tutorial only works as of version 1.2.4 because ox_lib is now used to create a zone instead of PolyZone.
</Callout>
To create a new zone you now can use the `/zone poly` command from ox_lib.

<Callout type="warning">
Make sure you use `/zone poly` if not you will get the zone in a wrong format at the end and cannot add it to the config.
</Callout>

After you have used the command, the following menu should open:

![creating_zone_menu](/creating_zone_menu.png)

You can now simply walk through the zone in-game and set points yourself. 
As soon as you have finished creating the zone, press [ENTER]. The following menu will now open:

![save_zone_menu](/save_zone_menu.png)

Now you can give the zone a name and select the format.

<Callout type="warning">
YOU MUST SELECT ARRAY FOR FORMAT OTHERWISE THE ZONE WILL NOT HAVE THE CORRECT FORMAT AND CANNOT BE INSERTED INTO THE SCRIPT.
</Callout>

Zones will be saved to `ox_lib/created_zones.lua` with your chosen format an will look like this:
```lua
{
    name = poly,
    points = {
        vec(447.9, -998.8, 25.8),
        vec(450.3, -998.2, 25.8),
        vec(449.9, -995.5, 25.8),
        vec(447.2, -995.6, 25.8),
        vec(446.3, -997.9, 25.8),
    },
    thickness = 2,
},
```
You can now simply copy the points and thickness and paste them into the config of it-drugs.

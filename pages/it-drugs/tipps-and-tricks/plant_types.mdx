### Plant Types
<Callout type="warning">
This list is for the new version of it-drugs (1.3.0) and may not work with older versions of the script.
We would recommend updating to the latest version. [How to update](https://docs.it-scripts.com/it-drugs/update)
</Callout>

Here you can find a list of all default plant types that are available in the script. You can use these plant types to create your own plants in the script.
If you want to use a plant type, you can simply copy the name and paste it into the config below `Config.PlantTypes` to the other plant types.

<Callout type="success">
Keep in mind that you can also create your own plant types. The script works with every prop that is available in the game.

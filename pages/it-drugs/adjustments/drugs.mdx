# ðŸ’Šãƒ»Drugs
With the script, it is also possible to create your own consumable drugs directly. For these to be active in the game, `Config.EnableDrugs` must be set to **true**.

## Config.Drugs
```lua
['joint'] = { -- item that can be used in game
    label = 'Joint',
    animation = 'smoke', -- Animations: blunt, sniff, pill
    time = 80, -- Time in seconds of the Effects
    effects = { -- list of effects the drug have
        'intenseEffect',
        'healthRegen',
        'moreStrength',
        'drunkWalk'
    },
    cooldown = 360, -- Cooldown in seconds until you can use this drug again
},
```

<Callout type="info">
The cooldown is added to the normal effect time of the drug, in this case the cooldown is 80 + 360.
</Callout>

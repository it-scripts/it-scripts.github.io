<Callout type="warning">
  All growth related configurations have significant impacts on the plant growth system. 
  Making any changes to the growth system requires thorough testing and debugging. 
  We strongly recommend any changes are made carefully and methodically as any changes can have unintended consequences.
</Callout>
Now we can look at the configuration of the individual plants.

## Allowed Grounds
### Config.OnlyAllowedGrounds

Config.OnlyAllowedGrounds is used to set whether a plant may only be planted on permitted grounds. 
If Config.OnlyAllowedGrounds is set to true, the player can only plant on grounds set in Config.AllowedGrounds.

### Config.AllowedGrounds
A list of ground hashes, if a desired ground is not included, the ground hash can be displayed when planting if Config.Debug is true, this can then simply be added to the list.

## Decay
The decay settings can be used to set how many percent of water or fertilizer a plant should lose per minute.

## Threshold
The threshold value is the percentage value at which a plant begins to lose life. 
As soon as the values of the plant are below Config.FertilizerThreshold or Config.WaterThreshold, the plant starts to lose life.

The rate at which the plant should lose life can be set with Config.HealthBaseDecay. 
The first value is the minimum and the second value is the maximum. 
A value between these two values is determined every minute. The plant loses this value of life.

## Config.Items
```lua
['liquid_fertilizer'] = {
    water = 15,
    fertilizer = 15,
    itemBack = nil,
},
```
You can always set 3 values for each item.\
`water` this value determines the percentage of water this item adds to the plant. \
`fertilizer` this value determines the percentage of fertilizer this item adds to the plant. \
`itemBack` here you can specify another item that the player should get back after using the item.

## Config.PlantTypes
Here you can set the items that can be used to fertilize and/or water the plant.

```lua
["plant1"] = {
    [1] = {"bkr_prop_weed_01_small_01a", -0.5},
    [2] = {"bkr_prop_weed_med_01a", -0.5},
    [3] = {"bkr_prop_weed_lrg_01a", -0.5},
},
```
```lua
["plant1"]
```
This is the unique name of the plant type. The name must not contain any special characters or spaces. 

This will be used later to give a plant a type.

---

```lua
[1] = {"bkr_prop_weed_01_small_01a", -0.5},
[2] = {"bkr_prop_weed_med_01a", -0.5},
[3] = {"bkr_prop_weed_lrg_01a", -0.5},
```
Each plant type consists of three sizes. 
A separate prop can be set for each size. 
A value can also be added for each prop. 
This value is then subtracted from or added to the z-coordinate of the plant.

```lua
[stage] = {"prop", z-value},
```

## Config.Plants
```lua
['weed_lemonhaze_seed'] = {
    label = 'Lemon Haze', -- Label for the plant
    plantType = 'plant1', -- Choose plant types from (plant1, plant2, small_plant)
    growthTime = false, -- Cutsom growth time in minutes false if you want to use the global growth time
    onlyZone = false, -- Set to zone id if you want to plant this seed only in a specific zone 
    zones = {'weed_zone_one', 'weed_zone_two'}, -- Zones where the seed can be planted
    products = { -- Item the plant is going to produce when harvested with the max amount
        ['weed_lemonhaze'] = {min = 1, max = 4},  
        --['other_item'] = {min = 1, max = 2}
    },
    seed = {
        chance = 50, -- Percent of getting back the seed
        min = 1, -- Min amount of seeds
        max = 2 -- Max amount of seeds
    },
    time = 3000, -- Time it takes to plant/harvest in miliseconds
},
```
```lua
['weed_lemonhaze_seed']
```
We start with the plant id, this specifies the name of the plant, the name is only relevant for the script.
The plant id must not contain any special characters or spaces and must be unique.

---

```lua
growthTime = 45
```
Here you can specify a custom growthtime for the plant, which overwrites the global growthtime and must be specified in minutes.

---

```lua
label = 'Lemon Haze
```
The label of the plant, this is used to display the name of the plant in all menus.

---

```lua
plantType = 'plant1'
```
The plant type is defined here; you can choose from any of the types defined in `Config.PlantTypes`.

---

```lua
products = {
    ['weed_lemonhaze'] = {min = 1, max = 4},
    --['other_item'] = {min = 1, max = 2}
},
```

---

```lua
seed = {
    chance = 50, -- Percent of getting back the seed
    min = 1, -- Min amount of seeds
    max = 2 -- Max amount of seeds
},
```

---

```lua
time = 3000 -- Time it takes to plant/harvest in miliseconds
```

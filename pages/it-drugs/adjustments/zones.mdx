<Callout type="warning">
  All growth related configurations have significant impacts on the plant growth system. 
  Making any changes to the growth system requires thorough testing and debugging. 
  We strongly recommend any changes are made carefully and methodically as any changes can have unintended consequences.
</Callout>

First, let's take a look at zone management. 
Here, it is possible to create zones that can have an effect on the growth speed of certain plants.

## Config.GlobalGrowTime
This variable defines the growth rate in minutes for the plants and is taken as the base value for all future modifications.

## Config.OnlyZones
<Callout type="warning">
  **Deprecated:** From version **1.3.0** you can make this setting for each plant individually
</Callout>

To use the different zone settings, this variable must be set to true. 
As long as it is set to false, any modification in the zones will not be used.

## Config.Zones
The individual zones can be created and edited here. 
We will now take a closer look at one zone and explain what the individual values mean and what they change.

```lua
['weed_zone_one'] = { -- Zone id (Musst be unique)
    points = {
        vec3(2031.0, 4853.0, 43.0),
        vec3(2007.0, 4877.0, 43.0),
        vec3(1981.0, 4903.0, 43.0),
        vec3(2006.0, 4929.0, 43.0),
        vec3(2032.0, 4903.0, 43.0),
        vec3(2057.0, 4878.0, 43.0),
    },
    thickness = 4.0,
    growMultiplier = 2, -- GlobalGrowTime / growMultiplier = Time in minutes for a plant to grow in this zone
    
    blip = {
        display = true, -- Display blip on map
        sprite = 469, -- Select blip from (https://docs.fivem.net/docs/game-references/blips/)
        displayColor = 2, -- Select blip color from (https://docs.fivem.net/docs/game-references/blips/)
        displayText = 'Weed Zone',
    },
},
```

---

```lua
['weed_zone_one']
```
We start with the zone id, this specifies the name of the zone, the name is only relevant for the script. 
The zone id must not contain any special characters or spaces and must be unique.

---

```lua
points = {
    vec3(2031.0, 4853.0, 43.0),
    vec3(2007.0, 4877.0, 43.0),
    vec3(1981.0, 4903.0, 43.0),
    vec3(2006.0, 4929.0, 43.0),
    vec3(2032.0, 4903.0, 43.0),
    vec3(2057.0, 4878.0, 43.0),
},
thickness = 4.0,
```
<Callout type="warning">
**Make sure that all z coordinates (laste number) are the same, otherwise the zone will not be created.**
</Callout>

The points define the area of the zone. 
A straight line is drawn between two consecutive `vec3() or vec()` to define the edge of the zone. 
A line is also automatically drawn between the last and `first vec3()`.

The thickness can be left at 4 if the zone is created manually. 
However, since the script now uses ox_lib for the zones, this can also be created more easily. 
You can find more information here:

As soon as a player plants a plant in such a zone, it is affected by the zone settings.

---

```lua
growMultiplier = 2,
```
The time it takes a plant to grow is divided by this value to calculate the new time. 
So with a 2, the growth is twice as fast as normal.

---

```lua
blip = {
    display = true, -- If true blip will be displayed
    sprite = 469, -- Select blip from (https://docs.fivem.net/docs/game-references/blips/)
    displayColor = 2, -- Select blip color from (https://docs.fivem.net/docs/game-references/blips/)
    displayText = 'Weed Zone', -- Name that will displayed on the map
},
```
The blip fie zone can be set here. 
The blip is always displayed in the middle of the zone.
